<!--
Hello Hardik! To make this profile truly yours, you'll need to customize a few things.

Banner Image: I've used a placeholder for your banner. You should create a personal banner (size: 1500x500 pixels is good) and upload it to your repository. Then, replace the placeholder link with the link to your image. I'll explain how in the instructions.

Theme Stats: The GitHub stats card has themes. I've set it to a theme that works with both light and dark modes, but you can find many more themes here: https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats/blob/master/themes/README.md
